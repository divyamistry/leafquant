# LeafQuant Programs

### These set of programs were used in [(Whigham et.al.)](http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI-02-15-0027-FI) to quantify barley leaf images.

There are two programs available for use at the moment: [LeafQuant-VIGS](LeafQuant-VIGS) and [LeafQuant-T3S](LeafQuant-T3S)

I welcome any comments and bug reports. Feel free to get in touch with me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/divyamistry) or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/divyamistry/leafquant/issues).
