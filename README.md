# LeafQuant Programs

### These set of programs were used in [(Whigham et.al.)]() to quantify barley leaf images

There are two programs available for use at the moment: [LeafQuant-VIGS](LeafQuant-VIGS) and [LeafQuant-T3S](LeafQuant-T3S)

I welcome any comments and issues. Feel free to get in touch with me via GitHub or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/divyamistry).

_**Note:** While LeafQuant-T3S is usable at the moment, it is not in its final form. Use it cautiously for analysis. The final update should be done in not too distant future._
